# Example - Rick roll

This DuckyScript payload is designed to deliver the ultimate Rick Roll experience. It opens a web browser, navigates to the classic Rick Roll video, uses an ESP32 Marauder to broadcast the lyrics over WiFi, and displays Rick Astleyâ€™s iconic image on an LCD screen.

**Note** The images to be displayed have been developed for the smallest screen supported. If you are using a device with a larger screen you will encounter unfilled areas of the display.
