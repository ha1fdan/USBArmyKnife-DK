REM At time of writing these don't have WiFi, LED or a button

REM To run these tests copy this file and disk.img from the covert storage example to the SD
REM You'll also need to have the agent running. You should see:
REM * Test card with correct colours
REM * Pulsing heartbeat in the lower right of the TFT
REM * Web page loaded via badUSB
REM * Disk mounted
REM * Device resetting

REM Wait for the agent, this also allows us to see some debug if we are monitoring
