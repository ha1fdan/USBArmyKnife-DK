# Example - Single use covert storage

This example shows how to masquerade as two different USB mass storage devices. The first time the device is plugged in the devices appears with the full contents of the micro SD card in read-write mode. In all subsequence attempts a different read-only 'benign' drive appears.

This example turns WiFi, LCD and the LED off for covertness.
